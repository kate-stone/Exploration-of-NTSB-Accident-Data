# Exploration of NTSB Accident Data

Since its inception over a century ago, aviation has witnessed numerous advancements in safety engineering. Unlike their predecessors, modern aircraft are robust machines with many fail safes embedded to prevent harm to occupants. The human component of the system has also improved due to greater awareness of psychological and physiological factors that influence the way humans operate aircraft. All of these advancements have reduced the probability of aircraft accidents significantly, making flying a very safe form of transportation. 

However, there is still room for improvement. Just this year (Aug-2020) there have been 25 accidents involving scheduled commercial aircraft, resulting in a total of 296 fatalities ([International Civil Aviation Organization](https://www.icao.int/safety/iStars/Pages/Accident-Statistics.aspx)). There have been many more accidents still involving non-scheduled commercial aircraft. While flying is very safe, it is not perfect. This is why it is important to study aviation accident data in an effort to reduce accident rates even further. 

In this notebook I'll be exploring US aircraft accident data from [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)](https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx) to answer the following questions: 
- What US states have witnessed the most amount of accidents?;
- How have accidents trended over time?;
- Is there any seasonal trend in accident rates?;
- What are the most common weather conditions for accidents?:;
- During what phase of flight do most accidents occur?;
- What was the purpose of flight for most accidents?;
- Fatality rates in amateur built aircraft compared to professionally built aircraft?;
- What are the most common causes for accidents?
